We have a native iPhone app.  By default, the app is configured to use the Puget Sound instance of OneBusAway, but you can point the app to use your quick-start instance as well.

1. Download and install the [[OneBusAway iPhone app>>http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/onebusaway/id329380089?mt=8]] from the Apple app store.
1. From within the app, select the "More..." tab.
1. Select the "Settings" entry.
1. Change the API Server name to match hostname and port of your OneBusAway instance.
1. Make sure location services are enabled for the OneBusAway app.

Of course, for this to work, you're iPhone will need to be on the same network as the machine running your OneBusAway instance.
