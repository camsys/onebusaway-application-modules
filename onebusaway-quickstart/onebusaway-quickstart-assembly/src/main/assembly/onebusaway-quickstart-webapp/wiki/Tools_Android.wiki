We have a native Android app.  By default, the app is configured to use the Puget Sound instance of OneBusAway, but you can point the app to use your quick-start instance as well.

1. Download and install the [[OneBusAway Android app>>https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.joulespersecond.seattlebusbot]] from the Google app store.
1. From within the app, select the "Help" menu item.
1. Select the "Preferences" entry.
1. Change the API Server name to match hostname and port of your OneBusAway instance.

Of course, for this to work, you're Android phone will need to be on the same network as the machine running your OneBusAway instance.
