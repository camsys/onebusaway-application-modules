Usage:
  (no args)                            Run a GUI-based wizard to configure transit data bundle and run your webapp							
  -build [opts] gtfs.zip bundle        Build a transit data bundle, necessary to power the webapp      
  -webapp [opts] bundle                Start the webapp, powered by the transit data bundle
  -help                                Show this message.

Running OneBusAway consists of two steps:

 1) Building a transit data bundle, combining raw transit data into optimized data structures for serving.
 2) Running the webapp, hosting the transit data stored in the bundle.

By default, if you run the quickstart with no arguments, it starts a GUI wizard that walks you through these two steps
with only the most basic configuration.

You can also run these steps from the command-line.  In the simplest case, you need a GTFS file, and a directory to
store your transit data bundle:

 % java -Xmx1G -server -jar onebusaway-quickstart.war -build path/to/your/gtfs.zip path/to/your/bundle
 % java -Xmx1G -server -jar onebusaway-quickstart.war -webapp path/to/your/bundle

Each phase (-build, -webappp) has specific options as well.  You can see all the options with the following commands:

 % java -jar onebusaway-quickstart.war -build -help
 % java -jar onebusaway-quickstart.war -webapp -help

If you aren't comfortable with the command-line, you can also run a GUI-based wizard to walk you through the various
configuration steps and get you up and running.

 % java -jar onebusaway-quickstart.war -gui
