# OneBusAway Web

OneBusAway provides a number of ways for riders to easily access information about public transit over the web.  The
primary method is our standard web interface.  Users can quickly look for nearby stops on a map:

Users can also search for a particular route:

When a user has found their stop, they can get more details about that stop, including upcoming arrivals, the complete
schedule, and routes serving that stop:

Users can see real-time arrival and departure information for a particular stop.  These stop pages are easily
bookmarable for quick access, and include filtering by route.

In addition to the standard web interface, OneBusAway also offers a simple text-only interface defined for basic
web-browsers on feature phones:
