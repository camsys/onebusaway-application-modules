# The &lt;route/&gt; Element

The `<route/>` element models agencies in OneBusAway.  Routes are directly mapped from entries in the [GTFS routes.txt](http://code.google.com/transit/spec/transit_feed_specification.html#routes_txt___Field_Definitions) file from the GTFS feeds that power an API instance.

## Example

    <route>
      <id>1_48</id>
      <shortName>48</shortName>
      <longName>U Dist/Greenwood</longName> 
      <description>U Dist/Greenwood</description>
      <type>3</type>
      <url>http://metro.kingcounty.gov/tops/bus/schedules/s048_0_.html</url>
      <color>00FFFF</color>
      <textColor>FF0000</textColor>
      <agencyId>1</agencyId>
    </route>

## Details

The fields of the route element closely match the fields defined for routes in the [GTFS spec](http://code.google.com/transit/spec/transit_feed_specification.html#routes_txt___Field_Definitions).

A few important details:

* The only fields that are absolutely required are `id`, `type` and `agencyId`.
* Agencies are not required to specify both a shortName and longName, thought they must specify at least one.  Some will specify one but not the other.  Others will include both.  Confounding matters even more, some agencies (ahem King County Metro) don't specify a longName but do specify a description that's effectively a longName.  The result is that care must be taken when constructing a route name by using the information that you're actually given.
