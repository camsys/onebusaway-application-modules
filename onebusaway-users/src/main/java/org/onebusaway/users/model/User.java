/**
 * Main user account object, designed to be serialized to a database.
 * 
 * A couple of design notes:
 * 
 * <h2>User Properties</h2>
 * 
 * The only properites that are included in the User object itself are those
 * that need be accessible from SQL/HQL queries. For the most part, there aren't
 * many of those. The bulk of user properties and data is stored in the
 * {@link UserProperties} object attached to each user. This is just a Java bean
 * that is serialized to and from the database for each user.
 * 
 * Why the serialized bean for user properties? This approach gives us more
 * flexibility as user properties change over time, as driven by new
 * functionality. The addition, modification, or deletion of a property can get
 * quite complex when it means changing the underlying database schema,
 * especially as the user table grows larger and you consider the need to
 * upgrade production systems on the fly.
 * 
 * Instead, the serialized bean approach allows us to lazily upgrade beans as
 * they are accessed. We rely on handlers registered with the
 * {@link UserPropertiesService} to manage versioning of {@link UserProperties}
 * implementations and migration between them.
 * 
 * <h2>User Indices</h2>
 * 
 * Each user has a numeric id that uniquely identifies the user account.
 * However, we often want to lookup and authenticate a user by a variety of
 * other indices: username, phone number, web cookie, OpenID id, Twitter
 * account, email, Facebook account. To support all those mechanisms in a
 * flexible way, each {@link User} object has a set of {@link UserIndex} objects
 * associated with it (see {@link #getUserIndices()}). Each user index has a
 * type (ex. username) and value (ex. admin), plus some credential information
 * that can be used for authenticating a user through that user index.
 *
