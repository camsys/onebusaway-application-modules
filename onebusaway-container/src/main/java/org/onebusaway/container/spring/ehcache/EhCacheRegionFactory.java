/**
 * A Hibernate EhCacheRegionFactory implementation that supports directly
 * setting the {@link CacheManager} from an existing instance. This allows us to
 * dynamically configure out CacheManager using Spring and then pass it into
 * Hibernate.
 *
 * Unfortunately, the EhCacheRegionFactory cannot be passed as an instance
 * object to Hibernate, but instead as a class name to be created by Hibernate
 * itself. Thus, there is no easy way to connect it the Spring application
 * context. As a kludge to get around that, we have a static
 * {@link #setStaticCacheManagerInstance(CacheManager)} that can be called from
 * the Spring application context config to supply the {@link CacheManager}
 * instance. It's a hack, but I don't see any way around it.
